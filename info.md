Thiefdom is a simple side scrolling game.
Player must acquire a certain amount of treasure located on a level, complete main/side quests and leave the area. 
Avoiding enemies or eliminating them using tools at hand is essential as direct combat may prove too difficult, 
although developing fighting skills is also an option to defeat threats.
